        <p align=justify>Founded by Amanda Kennedy in 2018, Citizen-Centered Design applies approaches from Human-Centered Design to the realm of government. Citizen-Centered Design starts with peopleâ€”understanding their needs and creating solutions that meet those needs. </p>
        
        <p align=justify>Our goal is to create a toolkit that can equip you as government employees with Citizen-Centered Design methods that you can use within your community to improve the delivery of government services. </p>

        <p align=justify>We are excited to help you champion innovation within government. We also are using this website as a prototyping opportunity to constantly improve what we can offer you.
