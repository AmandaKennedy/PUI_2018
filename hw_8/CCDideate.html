    <!--Step One -->
    <div><h3 class="underline">Step One: Pinpoint the Problem</h3>
    <p>Decide which service your team of government employees needs to improve. Qualitative and/or quantitative evidence can help you here: leverage your 311 call center reports, web site analytics, and even social media to understand how services within your department could better serve your citizens. Set up conversations with folks within your department to understand their point of view and how they impact the service delivery.</p>

    <p>Use our matrix worksheet to keep track of the various service breakdowns that you uncover and decide which service to focus on.</p>

    <!--Step Two -->
    <div><h3 class="underline">Step Two: Learn About Your Citizens</h3>
    <p>Now that you have decided on a service to improve, set up interviews with the stakeholders who are impacted by the service in order to obtain a deeper understanding of stakeholders’ pain points, goals, and needs. These stakeholders could be:
        <ui>
            <li><strong>Service Customers</strong> pay for the service. Sometimes, service customers are the same as service users, but other times, they are not.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Users</strong> use the service.</li> 
            <li><strong>Service Backstage Employees</strong> work in the background of your service's agency and do not interact directly with end users of your service. </li>
            <li><strong>Service Frontstage Employees</strong> work within your government service agency and interact directly with users of your service. </li>
        </ui>
    <p>Set up 45- to 60-minute individual interviews with at least 5 stakeholders from each of the above groups in order to get a full picture of how they interact with your service. Ask open-ended, non-leading questions, and ask follow-up questions like, “Can you elaborate on that?” Have them get as specific as possible. Ask them to tell stories: “Can you tell me about the last time you did_____?” “Can you walk me through ______?”</p>
    <p>Invite a colleague to accompany you to the interview and take notes. </p>

    <!--Step Three -->
    <div><h3 class="underline">Step Three: Blueprint the Current State of Your Service</h3>
    <p>Now that you have gathered a lot of information from your interviews, you can transfer your notes to a service blueprint that describes the current state of your service. A service blueprint is a tool that can help you to map out the various interactions between stakeholders across each touchpoint of your service. According to the design agency <a href="https://www.cooper.com/journal/2014/07/service-design-101">Cooper</a>, touchpoints are “the medium through which value exchanges happen, leading to the outcomes of a service. Touchpoints are these exchange moments in which service users engage with the service.”</p>
    <p>For each touchpoint on a blueprint, you can also map out the breakdowns, opportunities, and any technology used, as well as overall phases that encompass multiple touchpoints.</p>

    <p>Use our service blueprint template to start mapping out the current state of your service.</p>

    <!--Step Four -->
    <div><h3 class="underline">Step Four: Ideate With Your Team</h3>
    <p>After completing your blueprint, take special note of the breakdowns.You can use these as opportunity areas to improve your service. With your team, set aside about two hours for ideation. The goal is to push your imagination to think of more creative and innovative solutions.</p>
    <p>For each breakdown, reframe it into a How Might We question, which will set the stage for ideation around the breakdown. To get the most out of your ideation, the How Might We question must be open-ended with some level of constraint, such as: <i>“How Might We help our 311 representatives better manage the influx of 311 requests while keeping it simple for citizens to report them?”</i> Have each of your team members generate multiple How Might Wes per service breakdown, and then vote on your favorite per service breakdown.</p>
    <p>Now it is time to ideate: Each person should fold a blank sheet of paper into eight squares. Time to play Crazy Eights: Set a repeating timer for one minute, and during each minute, sketch a different solution idea to solve for the service breakdown. At this point, don’t limit your ideas based on budget. The sky’s the limit, and you will have time to consider budget constraints later on as you hone in on solutions.</p>
    <p>Once the eight minutes is up, post all of your Crazy Eight sheets on a whiteboard and use one or two stickers to vote for your favorite. Repeat this process for each breakdown.</p>
    <p>Use our Crazy Eights worksheet with your team to start generating solution ideas.</p>
